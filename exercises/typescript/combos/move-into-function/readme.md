Allowed Refactorings [extract-function, inline-function, rename-*]

For each folder, look at the `start.ts` file and compare it to the `end.ts` file. If you are using vscode you can do a file comparison right in the editor, right click on the `start.ts` file in the File Explorer menu and select "Select for Compare", then right click the `end.ts` file and select "Compare to Selected". This will load a diff view between the files.

Perform a sequence of refactorings to get to the end state. Check out the solution file to get an idea of how you did.
