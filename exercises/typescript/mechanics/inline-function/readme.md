# Inline Function Exercises

Inline function is a core mechanic and is a building block for more complicated refactorings.

For each folder, look at the `start.ts` file for a comment specifying which function to inline:

```ts
// Inline this function
function ( ... ) {
  ...
}
```

Inline the function into its call sites, then compare your solution with a possible end state in `end.ts`.
