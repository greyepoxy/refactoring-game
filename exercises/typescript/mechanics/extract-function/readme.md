# Extract Function Exercises

Extract function is a core mechanic and is a building block for more complicated refactorings.

For each folder, look at the `start.ts` file for a section of code to extract into a function. The section will be marked with comments like this:

```ts
// Extract this block 

<the code to extract>

//
```

Extract the code block into a function, then compare your solution with a possible end state in `end.ts`. Note your extracted block will likely have a different name, that is okay these are not exercises in naming.

HINT: Most TypeScript editors have support for extracting highlighted code as a function. In vscode try using the "ctrl + ." hotkey after selecting your text.
