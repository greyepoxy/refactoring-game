# Extract Function Exercises

> Make sure to check out the [TypeScript setup instructions](../../readme.md)

Extract function is a core mechanic and is a building block for more complicated refactorings.

For each folder, look at the `start.ts` file for a section of code to extract into a function. The section will be marked with comments like this:

```ts
// Extract this block 

<the code to extract>

//
```

Extract the code block into a function, then compare how you did it to the `solution.md` file. Note your extracted block will likely have a different name, that is okay these are not exercises in naming.

NOTE: Most TypeScript editors have support for extracting highlighted code as a function. In vscode highlighting and then using the "ctrl + ." hotkey will trigger the sub-menu. The solution files all assume you are doing the extraction by hand, since extract function is not supported in all scenarios it is recommended to practice doing the manual extraction to learn what to look out for so you can also perform the extraction in cases that are to complex for the build in extract-function tooling.
