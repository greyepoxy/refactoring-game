# Refactoring Game [Experimental]
A series of refactoring exercises intended to be used as practice material for building fluency in refactoring.

# How do perform the exercises?

TODO... going to be something like
1. Fork the repo
1. Create a branch
1. For each exercise try to get from start state to end state using refactorings (need guidance on how best to view/perform the exercise)
1. Check-in after each refactoring (need some kind of check-in notation?)
1. Compare your check-in sequence to the solution branch
1. Share your check-in sequence with the world (on Twitter, as an issue?)
