# Refactoring Game [Experimental]
A series of refactoring exercises intended to be used as practice material for building fluency.

# How to perform the exercises?

1. Fork the repository, and clone the forked version locally.
1. Create a solution branch.
1. For your desired language check-out its setup instructions.
1. It is recommended to check-in after each refactoring (every time a sequence of actions leaves you in a buildable state that is behaviorally equivalent) so that you can revisit and share your steps.
1. After each exercise compare your refactoring sequence to the solution file and see how you did.
1. (Optional) Share your check-in sequence with the world (Also feel free to create an issue on this repository to leave some feedback).
