# Refactoring Game [Experimental]
A series of refactoring exercises intended to be used as practice material for building fluency.

# How do perform the exercises?

1. Fork the repo.
1. Create a solution branch.
1. Check-out the readme files accompanying the different exercises for specific instructions. It is recommended to start with [mechanics](exercises/typescript/mechanics/readme.md) and then move onto the [combo](exercises/typescript/combos/readme.md) exercises.
1. Recommended to check-in after each refactoring (every time a sequence of actions leaves you in a build-able state that is behaviorally equivalent) so that you can re-visit your steps and share your steps.
1. Recommended to use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [tslint plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) plugin, with the plugin enabled this project is setup to perform auto-formatting on save. Also there are some relevant rules configured to help with the refactorings.
1. After each exercise compare your refactoring sequence to the solution files and see how you did.
1. (Optional) Share your check-in sequence with the world (Also feel free to create an issue on this repository to leave some feedback).
